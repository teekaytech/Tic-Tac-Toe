# Ruby Enumerables

This is a cloned copy of some of the major enumerable methods, written with Ruby programming language. The goal is to ensure that the newly created methods perform the same function as the original ones.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Clone or download this repository to your local workstation.

### Prerequisites

Since all the code is written using ruby, `Ruby Runtime >= 1.9` is required to interpret the code. If you don't have ruby runtime already setup on your computer, follow the instruction for your specific operating system on the [official installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

### Usage

After cloning on your computer, open the folder using your terminal/commandline window and run

`ruby <name-of-ruby-script>.rb`

where `name-of-ruby-script` is any ruby file contained inside the folder, (for instance here, we have main.rb).
