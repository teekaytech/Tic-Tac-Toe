Please Note that you must have github installed on your PC, this can be done [here](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03).


### Prerequisites

Since all the code is written using ruby, `Ruby Runtime >= 1.9` is required to interpret the code. If you don't have ruby runtime already setup on your computer, follow the instruction for your specific operating system on the [official installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

### Usage

After cloning on your computer, open the folder using your terminal/command prompt window and run

`bin/main.rb`

### Introduction to Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. [read-more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

### How to play
- When the game is started (`bin/main.rb`), the game prompts the two players to enter their names simultaneously, after which the game displays the board and requests the first player to make a move.<br>

- The game board is a 3 x 3 matrix consisting of numbers from 1 to 9.
- The first player moves are represented on the board with 'X', while the second player moves represented with 'O'
- For a player to have a valid move, the player must select one of the available numbers on the board. Anything aside that represents an invalid move.<br>

- Any cell of the board consisting of player move identifiers (`X` or `O`) cannot be reselected. If selected, it is counted as an inalid move and such player is prompted to reselect/remake move as seen above.

- The players make moves one after the other. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.<br>

- If no player succeed in making the above arrangement till all moves are made, the game is ended in a draw.
