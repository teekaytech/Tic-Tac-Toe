# Tic Tac Toe Game with Ruby

This project aims to develop Tic Tac Toe Game with Ruby. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository (this page).
- Under the repository name, locate and click a green button named 'Clone or download'. 
- Copy the project URL as displayed.
- If you're running Windows Operating System, open your command prompt. On Linux, Open your terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. Leave as it is if the current location is where you want the project to be.
- Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

Please Note that you must have github installed on your PC, this can be done [here](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03).
### Prerequisites

Since all the code is written using ruby, `Ruby Runtime >= 1.9` is required to interpret the code. If you don't have ruby runtime already setup on your computer, follow the instruction for your specific operating system on the [official installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

### Usage

After cloning on your computer, open the folder using your terminal/commandline window and run

`ruby <name-of-ruby-script>.rb`

where `name-of-ruby-script` is any ruby file contained inside the folder, (for instance here, we have main.rb).
